# Instructions for Claude

## CRITICAL: Change Authorization Protocol

1. Only make changes explicitly requested by user
2. If you notice issues/improvements:
   - Describe the issue
   - Propose options (A, B, C)
   - WAIT for user approval
   - Never assume or proceed without "yes" or "proceed"
3. No unauthorized edits, no matter how "obvious" the fix seems
