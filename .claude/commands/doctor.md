Please run a comprehensive health check of the DSL Suggestions App. Verify:

1. **Project Structure**: Confirm all core files exist (index.html, dslSuggestionsApp.html, dslSuggestionsApp.js, dslSuggestionsEngine.js, dslSuggestionsConfig.js, etc.)

2. **Rules Directory**: Check that all 8+ rule files in the Rules/ directory are present and properly structured

3. **Configuration**: Validate dslSuggestionsConfig.js has all required rule configurations

4. **File Integrity**: Check for any syntax errors in JavaScript files

5. **Git Status**: Show current branch and any uncommitted changes

6. **Dependencies**: Verify this is a zero-dependency browser app (no package.json needed)

7. **Ready to Run**: Confirm the app can be opened by launching index.html or dslSuggestionsApp.html in a browser

Provide a summary report with:
- ✅ Green checkmarks for healthy components
- ⚠️  Warnings for potential issues
- ❌ Errors for critical problems
